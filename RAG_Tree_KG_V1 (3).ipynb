Designed as a decentralized protocol, Solana incorporates an innovative Proof-of-History (PoH) timing mechanism that is implemented prior to, and facilitates, its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol structure. The result is an ultrafast blockchain capable of processing more than 50,000 transactions per second, with the ability to scale as usage of the protocol grows without relying on Layer-2 systems or sharding.ContentsNative Scalability of the Solana BlockchainA New Blockchain Architecture: Proof of Stake and Proof of HistoryProof-of-Stake Consensus Algorithm With the SOL CoinSOL Token Structure and EconomicsNative Scalability of the Solana BlockchainThe scalability problem has plagued many cryptocurrencies since almost day one. Blockchain ledgers and decentralized payment networks provide decentralized security to users — but usually, the more decentralized security they provide, the longer it can take for new transactions to be verified and added to the blockchain. These networks are faced with the challenge of providing ample transaction speed as their user count and transaction volume continues to increase, while still preserving the security and decentralization of the network.When we talk about scalability and throughput, we’re referring to how many transactions can take place per second (this capability is called transactions per second (TPS)). With a high volume of transactions occurring every second, time becomes a crucial element for efficiency. Each computer (or node) processing transactions on a decentralized blockchain network --- has its own internal clock on which it operates. With thousands of nodes all over the world, there are bound to be slight discrepancies with local system clocks. This becomes problematic when the decentralized network needs to reach consensus about which transactions have taken place and the order in which they occurred. The timestamp synchronization problem is inherent in both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms.When transactions occur, they are timestamped according to their local system clock. Then, when other nodes verify the transactions, messages about their confirmation or rejection are also timestamped. The inherent discrepancies between local system clocks (even those from nodes acting in good faith) ultimately pave a path for attacks where bad actors can try to take over a cryptocurrency network using fake transaction broadcasts that closely approximate real timestamps —\\xa0for example, “fake stake” (or “resource exhaustion”) attacks in the case of PoS, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks in the case of PoW. To ensure that transactions have not been manipulated and that funds are spent only once, a lot of time and processing power needs to be dedicated to verifying timestamp accuracy in a PoW or PoS system.When all the respective clocks across the decentralized network are synchronized, transactions take much less time to verify because individual nodes do not have to dedicate so much processing power toward verifying various timestamps. This synchronization allows the network to optimize for speed, and as a result, the Solana blockchain is inherently fast and engineered for native scalability —\\xa0enabling higher energy efficiency and higher security through the low processing power and the tamper-resistant nature of its synchronized timestamps. Solana’s efforts to boost transaction speed rely on a semi-centralized structure in which a node leader is elected and all nodes agree to adopt one universal source of time.Solana’s built-in mechanism for synchronizing time across nodes helps the network support a theoretical peak capacity of 65,000 transactions per second, currently. Although this figure is supported by a testnet rather than real-world implementation, even at-scale speeds of 50% of Solana’s testnet capacity would be a groundbreaking achievement for the blockchain space. In terms of today’s transaction speeds, 65,000 transactions per second is around 10,000 times faster than Bitcoin, 4,000 times faster than Ethereum, and 35 times --- faster than Ripple — even around 2.5 times faster than Visa. The protocol is theoretically designed to scale with Moore’s Law, doubling in capacity every two years with improvements in hardware and bandwidth. In other words, as computers get faster, so will Solana.A New Blockchain Architecture: Proof of Stake and Proof of HistoryMost existing blockchains largely ignore the role of time in their function, with each node timestamping transactions and messages about their confirmation or rejection solely according to its local clock, and sorting out the discrepancies later on. This becomes problematic when the decentralized nodes of a network must reach consensus about the validity of transactions and the order in which they occurred.In traditional consensus methods, all of the nodes must communicate with one another to determine that time has passed. Each node submits an upvote or downvote for any given block to indicate that the block is valid or invalid, respectively. A certain number of upvotes must be counted in order for a block to be considered valid by the network. So, if a local clock produces a timestamp that widely differs from the time used by other validators, it can result in a delay in confirmation time or even rejection of the block.Because nodes must communicate back and forth to establish the passing of time, a significant amount of processing power and time must be dedicated to determining the correct chronological order of messages and transactions. The longer it takes to reach consensus, the slower the process of adding new blocks becomes because the next block cannot be verified and added to a blockchain until the current one is confirmed.Without a trusted source of time, discrepancies between individual device clocks can become a recurring and significant problem, in which there is no guarantee that each node or network participant will verify the authenticity of a message quickly or accurately.Solana’s blockchain protocol is designed to provide a verifiable passage of time and still preserve many decentralized characteristics without resorting to a “central clock.” The project employs what is known as a Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus method to add the element of time to the Solana blockchain ledger. PoH is designed to cryptographically verify the passage of time between two events. It chains messages from nodes about the validity of blocks together to provide a relative chronological order of events that is not dependent upon local clocks or timestamps.To accomplish this, a network node is selected as the leader and placed in charge of generating a PoH sequence. This leader sequences messages for maximum --- efficiency and throughput. The ordered output is sent to replicator nodes called validators, which are in charge of verification for the consensus algorithm. At any given time, there is one leader on the network, which is chosen by PoS elections. Solana’s PoS system relies on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism called Tower Consensus. Tower Consensus leverages PoH as a global source of time before consensus is achieved in order to reduce latency.Any validator node is eligible to be chosen as the PoH leader. If there is any failure detected with the PoH generator, then the validator node with the next highest voting power will be chosen to replace the original leader.Proof-of-Stake Consensus Algorithm With the SOL CoinSOL is the native coin of the Solana blockchain. The validators who process transactions and run the network — as well as the leaders who generate PoH sequences — are chosen according to how much stake they have in the network's overall success, represented by how much SOL they have staked. The nodes with the biggest stakes likely will be chosen to validate and add transactions to the blockchain, thereby earning the associated rewards. This structure ensures that those running the network have a strong incentive to guarantee that it performs optimally and without failure.Users who hold only a small amount of SOL can also delegate their SOL to a larger validator. By doing so, they can earn a portion of the validator rewards despite not having enough SOL to become a validator themselves. This method of delegation incentivizes even those with small SOL holdings to support the Solana network.Solana’s incentive system increases the overall security of its network, as many people are financially invested in its proper functioning. It also deters malicious and frivolous actors from attacking the Solana blockchain because of the staking requirements to become an active network participant.SOL Token Structure and Economics\\xa0In addition to providing staked users with eligibility to become a validator or leader, SOL can be used for generating staking rewards, paying transaction fees on the Solana network, and PoS voting for governance of the network.500 million SOL tokens were initially minted. Of that amount, 12.5% were retained by the founders, 1.6% were sold at auction, 35.4% were allocated to locked investors, 38% were designated as community tokens; and 12.5% are held by the Solana Foundation, --- which is operated by an independent board in Geneva, Switzerland. The foundation’s funds are used for programs, marketing, grants, and the continued development and support of Solana. By design, Solana transaction fees are paid in SOL and burnt (or permanently destroyed) as a deflationary mechanism to reduce the total supply and thereby maintain a healthy SOL price.Cryptopedia does not guarantee the reliability of the Site content and shall not be held liable for any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies.

An overview of how Solana grew from nothing to one of the largest crypto coins.  Solana is the fastest blockchain in the world and the fastest-growing ecosystem in crypto, with over 400 projects spanning DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and more.31October201731 October 2017 Publication paperIn November of 2017, Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper describing Proof of History, a technique for keeping time between computers that do not trust one another. From Anatoly's previous experience designing distributed systems at Qualcomm, Mesosphere and Dropbox, he knew that a reliable clock makes network synchronization very simple. When synchronization is simple the resulting network can be blazing fast, bound only by network bandwidth.30November201730 November 2017 New blockchain techniqueAnatoly watched as blockchain systems without clocks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggled to scale beyond 15 transactions per second worldwide when centralized payment systems such as Visa required peaks of 65,000 tps. Without a clock, it was clear they'd never graduate to being the global payment system or global supercomputer most had dreamed them to be. When Anatoly solved the problem of getting computers that don’t trust each other to agree on time, he knew he had the key to bring 40 years of distributed systems research to the world of blockchain. The resulting cluster wouldn't be just 10 times faster, or a 100 times, or a 1,000 times, but 10,000 times faster, right out of the gate!31December201731 December 2017 Greg FitzgeraldAnatoly's implementation began in a private codebase and was implemented in the C programming language. Greg Fitzgerald, who had previously worked with Anatoly at semiconductor giant Qualcomm Incorporated, encouraged him to reimplement the project in the Rust programming language. Greg had worked on the LLVM compiler infrastructure, which underlies both the Clang C/C++ compiler as well as the Rust compiler. Greg claimed that the language's safety guarantees would improve software productivity and that its lack of a garbage collector would allow programs to perform as well as those written in C. Anatoly gave it a shot and just two weeks later, had migrated his entire codebase to Rust. Sold. With plans to weave all the world's transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called the project --- Loom.12February201812 February 2018 First prototypeOn February 13th of 2018, Greg began prototyping the first open source implementation of Anatoly's whitepaper. The project was published to GitHub under the name Silk in the loomprotocol organization. On February 28th, Greg made his first release, demonstrating 10 thousand signed transactions could be verified and processed in just over half a second. Shortly after, another former Qualcomm cohort, Stephen Akridge, demonstrated throughput could be massively improved by offloading signature verification to graphics processors. Anatoly recruited Greg, Stephen and three others to co-found a company, then called Loom.27February201827 February 2018 Loom rebranded to SolanaAround the same time, Ethereum-based project Loom Network sprung up and many people were confused about whether they were the same project. The Loom team decided it would rebrand. They chose the name Solana, a nod to a small beach town North of San Diego called Solana Beach, where Anatoly, Greg and Stephen lived and surfed for three years when they worked for Qualcomm. On March 28th, the team created the Solana GitHub organization and renamed Greg's prototype Silk to Solana.27April201827 April 2018 Elevator pitch at Xoogler Demo DayIn April of 2018, Alan the business developer of Solana, gave a pitch session at Google Headquarters in San Francisco.17June201817 June 2018 Testing transaction speedIn June of 2018, the team scaled up the technology to run on cloud-based networks and on July 19th, published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second. In a later release in December, called v0.10 Pillbox, the team published a permissioned testnet running 150 nodes on a gigabit network and demonstrated soak tests processing an average of 200 thousand transactions per second with bursts over 500 thousand. The project was also extended to support on-chain programs written in the C programming language and run concurrently in a safe execution environment called BPF.29July201929 July 2019 Solana raises $20MBetween Apr. 2018 and Jul. 2019, the team raised a little over $20 million in various private token sales. They announced the sales as a single Series A in late-July 2019.29February202029 February 2020 Launch Mainnet BetaSolana launched on Mainnet Beta in Mar. 2020, shortly after raising --- $1.76 million in a public token auction hosted on CoinList. The project's beta network featured basic transaction capabilities and smart contract support. But it did not include any staking rewards as Solana was still determining its ongoing issuance schedule. The current plan is to upgrade from its current beta stage to a more production-ready version in either later 2020 or early 2021.05May202005 May 2020 Explaning proof of historyThe core Solana innovation is Proof of History (POH), a globally-available, permissionless source of time in the network that works before consensus. POH is not a consensus protocol or anti-Sybil mechanism. Rather, POH is a solution to the clock problem.25March202125 March 2021 First NFT project mintedKreechures are Solana's first crypto-collectible NFT RPG. Built on #Solana.

              " 1: \"--- --- --- --- --- --- Staking | SolanaLearnDevelopersSolutionsNetworkCommunitySearchStaking and Inflation FAQOverviewThrough an on-chain governance process, Solana's community of validators voted to enable staking rewards and inflation, which are now live.SOL token holders can earn rewards and help secure the network by staking tokens to one or more\\xa0validators on Solana’s Mainnet Beta .Returns/yield for staked tokens is based on the current inflation rate, total number of SOL staked on the network, and an individual validator’s uptime and commission (fee).Solana's initial inflation rate is 8% annually, decreasing by 15% year-over-year, reaching a long-term fixed inflation rate of 1.5% annually.Staking OverviewWhat is Proof-of-Stake?On the Solana network, many different people andentities run a program on specialized computers known asa validator. Validators play a key role in maintainingand securing the Solana blockchain. Validators areresponsible for processing new incoming transactions onthe network, as well as for voting on and appending newblocks to the blockchain.As different validators around the world may receivedifferent pieces of information at different times, itis essential that the network is able to come toagreement about which transactions and data arecontinually added to the blockchain. The strategy bywhich the validators and the entire network come to thisagreement is known as the consensus mechanism, and is acore challenge to building a successful decentralizedblockchain network. Many different projects haveattempted various solutions on how to reach consensus ina fast and cost-efficient manner.The Solana network uses a Proof-of-Stake consensusmechanism (often abbreviated to PoS). Every validator onthe network has an opportunity to participate inconsensus by casting votes for which blocks they believeshould be added to the blockchain, thereby confirmingany valid transactions contained in those particularblocks. However, not all validator’s votes are weightedequally.Validator’s consensus votes are stake-weighted, meaningthe more stake an individual validator has, the moreinfluence that one validator has in determining theoutcome of the consensus voting. Similarly, validatorswith less stake have less weight in determining the voteoutcome, and validators with no stake cannot influencethe outcome of a consensus vote.What is --- staking?Staking is the process by which a SOL token holder (such as someone who purchased SOL tokens on an exchange) assigns some or all of their tokens to a particular validator or validators, which helps increase those validators’ voting weight. Assigning your tokens to add to a validator’s stake-weight is known as “delegating” your tokens. Delegating your tokens to a validator does NOT give the validator ownership or control over your tokens. At all times, you still control all your staked tokens that you may have chosen to delegate.By staking tokens with a validator or validators, the token holder indicates a degree of trust in the validator they chose to delegate to. As validators amass larger amounts of stake delegations from different token holders, this acts as “proof” to the network that the validator’s consensus votes are trustworthy, and their votes are therefore weighted proportionally to the amount of stake the validator has attracted. By weighing the collective votes from all validators against the proportion of stake that has been delegated to them, the network reaches consensus by this Proof of Stake.As different validators around the world may receivedifferent pieces of information at different times, itis essential that the network is able to come toagreement about which transactions and data arecontinually added to the blockchain. The strategy bywhich the validators and the entire network come to thisagreement is known as the consensus mechanism, and is acore challenge to building a successful decentralizedblockchain network. Many different projects haveattempted various solutions on how to reach consensus ina fast and cost-efficient manner.The Solana network uses a Proof-of-Stake consensusmechanism (often abbreviated to PoS). Every validator onthe network has an opportunity to participate inconsensus by casting votes for which blocks they believeshould be added to the blockchain, thereby confirmingany valid transactions contained in those particularblocks.

Similarly, validatorswith less stake have less weight in determining the voteoutcome, and validators with no stake cannot influencethe outcome of a consensus --- vote.Why stake?In an open and decentralized network like Solana, anyone can run a validator if they choose. A malicious validator or other bad actor could attempt to attack the network or to submit incorrect or fraudulent transactions for their own gain. Because of the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism described above, a single entity acting alone in this fraudulent manner would need to attract some amount of stake before any of their proposed activities would be weighed in the consensus vote. --- As more token holders choose to stake their SOL tokens to different validators across the network, and the total amount of stake on the network increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for even a coordinated and well-funded attacker to amass enough stake to single-handedly alter the outcome of a consensus vote for their own benefit.\\n\\nIn short, the more stake that is delegated to many different validators across the network, the more safe and secure the network becomes for all of its users.\\n\\nAdditionally, token holders who choose to stake their tokens and help secure the network in doing so, are eligible to receive staking rewards once they have delegated their tokens to one or more validators. More details on staking rewards are found below.Are there risks associated with staking?\\n  On many Proof-of-Stake networks, there exists a mechanism known as “slashing”.\\n  Slashing is any process by which some portion of stake delegated to a\\n  validator is destroyed as a punitive measure for malicious actions undertaken\\n  by the validator.\\n\\n\\n  This mechanism incentivizes validators not to undertake such actions, as less\\n  stake delegated to a validator means that validator then accrues fewer\\n  rewards. Being slashed can also be seen as a reputational risk for retaining\\n  current or attracting potential future stake.\\n\\n\\n  Slashing also poses a risk to token holders who could potentially lose some of\\n  their tokens if they have delegated to a validator which gets slashed. The\\n  presence of slashing could incentivize token holders to only delegate their\\n  tokens to validators they feel are reputable, and not to delegate all their\\n  tokens to a single or small number of validators.\\n\\n\\n  On Solana, slashing is not automatic. If an attacker causes the network to\\n  halt, they can be slashed upon network restart. For more information, please\\n  check out\\xa0the Solana Validator docs. --- Who can stake?Anyone who holds SOL can stake their tokens at any time.How do I stake my tokens?To stake SOL tokens, you must use a wallet that supports staking. Not all wallets support staking at this time. SolFlare.com is one user-friendly wallet that supports staking. Check out the official docs for\\xa0a list of wallets which support staking.SOL tokens in your wallet must first be moved into a stake account. You can create as many stake accounts as you like, and deposit as much or as little SOL into each stake account as you want. Each new stake account has a unique address, and a single wallet can manage or “authorize” many different stake accounts. Check out our docs on\\xa0stake account structure\\xa0for more details.In order to earn staking rewards (if inflation is enabled on Mainnet Beta), the tokens in a stake account must be delegated to a validator. A single stake account can only be delegated to a single validator at any time, so if you want to delegate to different validators you will need to split your tokens between multiple stake accounts.Where can I learn about the validators on Solana?\\n  There are various community-operated tools where you can view information\\n  about the network as well as certain performance metrics about individual\\n  validators, such as:\\n\\n\\n\\nSolanabeach.io\\n\\n\\nValidators.app\\n\\n\\n\\n  Many validators also chose to introduce themselves and their services on the\\n  Solana forums:\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://forums.solana.com/t/validator-information-thread/577 --- Can I stake tokens from an account if my tokens have a lockup?Yes. Some people may have received a stake account with locked up tokens from the Solana Foundation that was distributed in exchange for services. Tokens in stake accounts with a lockup may not be withdrawn to another wallet address before the lockup expires, but they may still be delegated to a validator to potentially earn staking rewards during this time. Rewards earned on locked tokens are deposited back into the locked stake account.How do I add tokens to a stake account?When you first create a stake account, you specify how many SOL tokens you want to fund it with, and these tokens are withdrawn from your main wallet account and deposited into the new stake account.Tokens can also be transferred into a pre-existing stake account at any time, by using your wallet’s Transfer or Send feature and providing the address of your stake account. If you transfer tokens into a stake account that is already delegated, these new tokens will not automatically be delegated.If you have a delegated stake account and you wish to increase your delegation to a particular validator, the best practice is to create a new stake account with the additional amount of stake and delegate that account to the same validator.Example: Increasing the stake delegated to a single validatorUser has a wallet with 1000 SOL balance.User uses the wallet interface to create a stake account with 100 SOL, then delegates the tokens in the stake account to Validator A.Wallet balance is now 900 SOL and the wallet also controls a stake account with a balance of 100 SOL.The stake account shows in the wallet interface and on the Explorer that it is “Activating”. Once it is “Active”, the staked tokens are eligible for rewards. See\\xa0Timing Considerations\\xa0for more details.Later, the user wants to increase their delegation to Validator A, so uses the wallet interface to create a second stake account with 50 SOL, then delegates the tokens in the new stake account to Validator A.Wallet balance is now 850 SOL and the wallet also controls 2 stake accounts with 100 and 50 SOL, respectively, each delegated to Validator A.If you transfer tokens into a stake account that is already delegated, these new tokens will not automatically be delegated. In order to get these new tokens also delegated and earning rewards, you would need to un-delegate the entire account, then re-delegate the same account. As --- un-delegating and re-delegating\\xa0can take several days to take effect, your original stake would not be earning rewards during this transition period.Therefore, we recommend only transferring SOL into a stake account when it is first created or otherwise not delegated.How do I remove tokens from an existing stake account?Tokens can only be withdrawn from a stake account when they are not currently delegated. When a stake account is first un-delegated, it is considered “deactivating” or “cooling down”. Tokens may not be withdrawn from the account until some or all of them have finished deactivating and are considered “inactive” and therefore no longer earning any potential staking rewards. For details on how long this transition period may take, please see\\xa0Timing Considerations.Once the tokens in a stake account are inactive, they can be withdrawn back to your main wallet address or to another address immediately.Example: Withdrawing all tokens from a stake accountUser has a wallet with a balance of 900 SOL, and a single stake account with 100 SOL delegated to a validator.User uses the wallet interface to Deactivate their stake delegation. The stake account shows in the wallet interface and on the Explorer that it is “Deactivating”. Once it is “Inactive” or “Not Delegated”, the staked tokens stop earning rewards and can be withdrawn. See\\xa0Timing Considerations\\xa0for more details.User can use the wallet interface to withdraw their all tokens back into their main wallet account. The wallet balance now shows 1,000 SOL and the stake account is closed.If you want to reduce the amount of delegated stake assigned to a given validator without deactivating your entire balance (and therefore missing any potential rewards during the delegation downtime), you can Split an existing stake account into two accounts, and undelegate one, while leaving the other account delegated and continuously eligible for rewards.Example: Reducing the delegation staked to a given validatorUser has a wallet with a balance of 800 SOL, and a single stake account with 200 SOL delegated to a validator.User wants to reduce the amount of stake delegated to the validator by 100 SOL.Use the wallet interface to “Split” the stake account, and specifies 100 SOL as the amount to split.There are now 2 stake accounts, each with 100 SOL which are each delegated --- to the same validator.User can then use the wallet interface to Deactivate one of their stake delegations. The stake account shows in the wallet interface and on the Explorer that it is “Deactivating”. Once it is “Inactive” or “Not Delegated”, the staked tokens stop earning rewards and can be withdrawn. See\\xa0Timing Considerations\\xa0for more details.Once the account is Inactive, the user can then choose to delegate the account to a different validator, or to withdraw the tokens back into the main wallet, or to further split the inactive stake account and delegate to multiple different validators.Tokens in a stake account with a lockup may not be withdrawn until the lockup expires, regardless of the delegation state of that account. Once the lockup expires, undelegated tokens may be withdrawn immediately. There is no action required by the account holder to specifically unlock the account.Delegation Timing ConsiderationsWhen you delegate or un-delegate a stake account, the tokens do not change state immediately. Newly delegated tokens are considered “activating” or “warming up”, and are not eligible to earn rewards until they are fully activated. Newly un-delegated tokens are considered “deactivating” or “cooling down” and are not able to be withdrawn until deactivated.The Solana protocol only allows stake tokens to finish changing state at the beginning of a new epoch. An epoch is approximately 2 days long. Use\\xa0solana epoch-info\\xa0to see details of the current epoch.If you delegate tokens in a stake account in the middle of an epoch, the tokens will appear in your wallet as “activating” until the current epoch ends, at which point they will be active and eligible to earn rewards. Whether you delegate your stake tokens near the beginning of the current epoch, or near the end of the current epoch does not impact when the tokens will become active, which is only at the next epoch boundary. The same logic applies to un-delegating or deactivating a delegated stake account. Deactivating tokens cannot be withdrawn until they have finished deactivating at the epoch boundary.There is a limit to how much total stake can change state in a single epoch across the entire Solana network. No more than 25% of the total active stake on the network can be activated or --- deactivated in a single epoch. In a scenario where more than 25% of the total active take on the network is being activated in a single epoch, a portion of all activating/deactivating stake up to the global 25% limit, will finish changing state at the first epoch boundary. The remaining stake would stay as “activating” or “deactivating” for at least one more epoch, until the next epoch boundary.If a stake activation takes multiple epochs, the portion of stake that becomes fully active at the first epoch boundary is eligible for rewards, while the remaining portion that is still activating for an additional epoch is not yet eligible for rewards.Similarly, if a stake deactivation takes multiple epochs, the portion of stake that becomes fully inactive at the first epoch boundary becomes able to be withdrawn, while the remaining portion is still deactivating for an additional epoch, at which point it can then be withdrawn.How can I check on the status of a specific stake account?All stake accounts on Solana (and all accounts of any variety) can be viewed on Solana’s network explorer, found here:Solana ExplorerCopy and paste the stake account address of interest in the main search bar of the explorer to see details of the account, including its activation/deactivation/delegation status, current balance, and the address of the stake account’s authorities, which would usually be the same as your wallet’s main address.Depending on which wallet solution you use to manage your stake accounts, this same information may be visible by logging in to your wallet and viewing your stake accounts.Staking RewardsHow do I estimate and view my staking rewards?Staking rewards are computed and issued once per epoch. An epoch is approximately 2 days long. Rewards accrued in a given epoch are issued to all validators and delegators in the first block of the following epoch. Staking yield is presented as an annualized figure, though this number varies each epoch as the inflation rate and total active stake continually change. Staking yield and the full inflation design is detailed in our official docs\\xa0here.Estimates of Staking Yield, given various models of the fraction of total SOL staked, can be explored here:STAKING YIELD MODELSTo estimate the amount of SOL a delegator can expect to see in a single epoch in a single stake account:What is Validator --- Uptime?Validator Uptime is defined by a validator’s consensus voting behavior. For each time a validator votes on a block that is ultimately appended to the blockchain, that validator earns one Vote Credit.When rewards are tallied at the end of the epoch, all the stake-weighted vote credits earned by all the validators are used to determine the total amount of SOL that is issued to each particular validator and their delegators.What is the Validator Fee/Commission?Validators charge a fee on inflationary rewards earned by the stake accounts that are delegated to them, in exchange for their services in securing the blockchain and processing transactions. This fee is known as the commission rate. Each time rewards are issued, the commission is deposited in the validator’s account and the remaining rewards are deposited in all of the stake accounts that are delegated to that validator, proportionally to the amount of actively delegated stake in each account. Validator commission and staking rewards are always issued simultaneously.When and where are staking rewards issued?Rewards are issued once per epoch and are deposited into the stake account that earned them. Stake rewards are automatically re-delegated as active stake.If the rewards due to a validator or one of their stakes is less than one lamport for a given epoch, reward issuance is deferred until the next epoch in which both would receive at least one lamport.EconomicsWhat will the inflation rate be?The details of the originally proposed inflation schedule are discussed here. The specific parameters that determine the inflation schedule are:Initial Inflation Rate: 8 %Dis-inflation Rate: −15%Long-term Inflation Rate: 1.5%The above parameters are defined as:Initial Inflation Rate: The starting Inflation Rate for when inflation is first enabled. The token issuance rate can only decrease from this amountDis-inflation Rate: The annualized rate at which the Inflation Rate is reducedLong-term Inflation Rate: The stable, long-term Inflation Rate to be expectedNote that the inflation rate will not be the same as the staking yield (i.e. the interest earned by staking tokens). See below for a discussion of staking yield.Where will the inflationary issuance be distributed?100% of the inflationary issuances are proposed to be delivered to delegated stake accounts and validators.What is the expected staking --- yield?Staking yield comes from inflationary issuances being distributed across delegated staking accounts and validator vote accounts per the validator commission rate. Due to this design, the staking yield is to be primarily a function of the fraction of SOL that is staked on the network. A detailed discussion of the design and its impact on staking yield can be found here:INFLATION DESIGN OVERVIEWThe amount of total SOL that will be staked is unknown, so we can only estimate the exact staking yields. Below, we show staking yields over time segmented by different values of the percent of staked SOL that might be observed on the network (between 60-90%). The inflation schedule parameters are set as described above.A simple interactive dashboard is provided here, in which different % of staked SOL can be selected to see the impact on prospective staking yields.Please note that this is an idealized Staked Yield as it neglects validator uptime impact on rewards, validator commissions, potential yield throttling and potential slashing incidents. It additionally ignores that % of Staked SOL is dynamic by design, i.e. it is expected that the % of staked SOL changes over time thus impacting the staking yield over time. It is only presented to be used as a rough estimate for expected staking yields.Managed by© 2024 Solana Foundation.

All Rights Reserved.HomeBlogCrypto BasicsWhat is Algorand (ALGO)?What is Algorand (ALGO)?Tangem teamMar 6, 2024BlockchainAlgorand is an enterprise-grade, programmable, layer-1 blockchain. The network, which provides instant finality and a block time of under three seconds, can process up to 10,000 transactions per second. Algorand achieves a high level of decentralization with no central authority, and a network of validators authenticates transactions. The protocol has gained widespread popularity in enterprise applications, particularly in\\xa0real-world asset tokenization, digital money, and payment infrastructure.\\xa0Who is behind Algorand?Silvio Micali, an MIT professor and Turing Award-winning cryptographer, founded Algorand in 2017, and the Algorand mainnet went live in 2019. Two entities are involved in the evolution of Algorand:\\xa0Algorand Technologies, which manages protocol development, and\\xa0Algorand Foundation, a non-profit organization established to drive the global adoption of Algorand blockchain technology. The Algorand Foundation fosters developer talent, creates educational content and courses, and works with leading organizations to achieve its mission.\\xa0\\xa0How does Algorand work?Let\\'s briefly discuss how Algorand works and what makes it different from similar blockchains.Pure proof-of-stakeAlgorand uses a pure proof-of-stake mechanism to reach consensus—in other words, to verify transactions and add another block to the blockchain. Soon, Algorand will introduce consensus incentivization, where validators will be rewarded for proposing blocks to the network.\\xa0\\xa0This consensus protocol works in rounds, where a block proposer and a set of voting committees are randomly chosen from the pool of all token holders (accounts with Algo). The chance of being selected is proportional to an account\\'s stake (the amount of --- Algo held relative to the total). Algorand utilizes sophisticated cryptographic algorithms like verifiable random functions and cryptographic sortition to ensure fairness, prevent collusion, and maintain high security.Want to learn more? Read \"Why Algorand?\"Verifiable random functions (VRFs)Verifiable random functions (VRFs) are a core part of Algorand\\'s consensus algorithm. They act like a lottery, randomly selecting a leader among participating Algo holders, with user selection being influenced by the amount of Algo staked. The advantage of VRFs is that the identity of the chosen leader is only known to them. This confidentiality enables the leader to validate and approve blocks without external influence. Leader identities are revealed only after the round ends, and the committee disbands. This ensures a new, independent committee is chosen for each round, keeping the blockchain process secure.VRFs, combined with the concept of user replaceability, are fundamental to Algorand\\'s security. There\\'s no single, vulnerable point of control – no central authority to target. Since communication between a central authority and leaders doesn\\'t exist, there\\'s no information to intercept. This eliminates a major attack vector and strengthens overall blockchain security.Smart contracts and smart signatures\\xa0Algorand supports two kinds of programs on the blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps): smart signatures and smart contracts.\\xa0Smart contracts\\xa0(also referred to as stateful smart contracts) are the recommended choice for most dApps. They are deployed to the blockchain and can be called remotely by any node. Once deployed, they can store data (global or local) and manage Algorand accounts\\' transactions, including asset transfers and escrow services. This makes them suitable for implementing core functionalities of dApps. Smart signatures, on the other hand, are stateless programs that provide cryptographic verification without permanent storage on the blockchain.Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs)\\xa0ASAs are like building blocks for creating your own tokens on the Algorand blockchain. Like ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum,\\xa0ASAs\\xa0offer a standardized way to issue and manage digital assets. ASAs can represent anything fungible or non-fungible, including stablecoins, real-world assets, loyalty points, system credits, and in-game points.\\xa0\\xa0FAQs: The Algorand blockchainWhat is Algorand?Algorand is a programmable, layer-1 blockchain designed to provide a decentralized, scalable, and secure --- infrastructure for building various applications at scale. Algorand\\'s features make it a popular choice for building enterprise blockchain applications. These applications focus on areas like tokenizing real-world assets, creating digital money, and building efficient payment infrastructure.How does Algorand achieve scalability?Algorand achieves scalability through its innovative pure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. PPoS efficiently selects validators to confirm transactions in a decentralized way. This enables high transaction volume (throughput) without sacrificing security or decentralization, leading to fast and secure transactions.What makes Algorand different from other blockchain platforms?Algorand distinguishes itself through its consensus mechanism, Pure Proof-of-Stake, which eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and enhances scalability. However, a key differentiator is Algorand\\'s strong resistance to forking. This makes it ideal for high-value real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. In such scenarios, a stable and reliable blockchain like Algorand is crucial to ensure the integrity and security of tokenized assets.How does Algorand ensure security?Algorand leverages cryptographic techniques and its powerful pure proof-of-stake consensus algorithm to maintain a secure and tamper-resistant network. This design goes beyond just securing transactions; it aims to prevent attacks altogether, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain and safeguarding user assets.Can I participate in the Algorand network?You can participate in the Algorand network by running a node. This contributes to the consensus mechanism by proposing and voting on blocks. Algorand will soon introduce consensus incentivization, which will reward block proposers for their contributions to the network. Learn more in the\\xa0Algorand 2024 roadmap.What are the use cases for Algorand?Algorand supports a variety of use cases, including financial applications, decentralized exchanges, supply chain management, real-world asset tokenization, and more. Its scalable infrastructure and support for smart contracts make it suitable for a broad range of applications.How can I get started with Algorand?To get started with Algorand, you can acquire Algo tokens through exchanges that support cryptocurrency. Once you have Algo, you can participate in the network by exploring decentralized applications (or building your own!) on the Algorand blockchain.Is Algorand environmentally friendly?Algorand was designed with the environment in mind. Its pure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism --- is energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work systems. Furthermore, the Algorand Foundation actively offsets its carbon footprint, making Algorand a truly\\xa0eco-friendly blockchain solution.What is the role of Algo in the Algorand ecosystem?Algo is the native cryptocurrency of the Algorand blockchain. It is used for transaction fees, participating in consensus, and as a means of value exchange within the ecosystem.How does Algorand contribute to financial inclusion?Algorand\\'s low fees, fast transactions, and accessibility make it a powerful tool for financial inclusion. The Algorand Foundation actively\\xa0supports projects building inclusive financial tools\\xa0such as microfinance solutions and mobile banking for underserved communities worldwide.Global Headquarters, Tangem\\xa0AGBaarerstrasse\\xa010, 6300 Zug, SwitzerlandLegalTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCompanyAbout TangemPartnershipMediaKitTangem GuideCopyright © 2024 Tangem AG.

This rewards deposit equated to their xGVP. Each Term Pool is locked for 12 months while the xGov Term is in session.\\nTerm Pools Unlocking Dates\\nTerm Pool 1 - 30 June 2024 - Payout scheduled for 3 July 2024\\nTerm Pool 2 - 30 September 2024\\nTerm Pool 3 - 31 December 2024\\nTerm Pool 4 - 31 March 2025\\nxGov Responsibilities\\nVote in every session: Once you have opted in, your tokens are locked for 12 months, and you must vote in every session in order to redeem your deposited Algo. As an xGov, if you fail to vote, you will lose your xGov status and forfeit your share of Algo in the Term Pool (or Term Pools, if you joined more than one Term Pool).\\nStay informed: Proposals can be found on the GitHub xGov Proposals Repository. You may not be an expert on all of the issues that xGovs are required to vote on, so it’s important to DYOR ahead of voting.\\nJoin the discussion: Review proposals with fellow xGovs on GitHub and the Algorand forum. Anyone can read the discussion, but you will need to make an account on each of these platforms in order to leave comments.\\nChecking your xGov Status\\nAs an xGov, view your xGov status through the xGov Portal by connecting the Algorand wallet you used for Governance when you opted into the xGov Program or your nominated controller address (available from Term Pool 2 onwards).\\nxGov Status Page: https://xgov.algorand.foundation/status\\nxGov Portal: https://xgov.algorand.foundation --- The xGov web portal was developed as the first minimum viable product (MVP).

PagePowered by GitBookVirtual VotingIt is not enough to ensure that every member knows every event. It is also --- necessary to agree on a linear ordering of the events, and thus of the transactions\\nrecorded inside the events. Most Byzantine fault tolerance protocols without a\\nleader depend on members sending each other votes...Some of these\\nprotocols require receipts on votes sent to everyone...And they\\nmay require multiple rounds of voting, which further increases the number of voting --- messages sent.This pure voting approach becomes bandwidth prohibitive and impractical in a network of any significant size but has the properties of being the fairest and most secure method of reaching consensus. The hashgraph algorithm implements voting that achieves the same fair and secure properties but is also very fast and practical. It accomplishes this through virtual voting.The hashgraph algorithm does not require any votes to be sent across the network to calculate the votes of each member. Members can calculate every other member’s votes by internally looking at each of their copies of the hashgraph and applying the virtual voting algorithm. Votes are calculated locally as a function of the ancestors of a given event.This virtual voting has several benefits. In addition to saving bandwidth, it ensures that members always calculate their votes according to the rules. If Alice is honest, she will calculate virtual votes for the virtual Bob that are honest. Even if the real Bob is a cheater, he cannot attack Alice by making the virtual Bob vote incorrectly.With this virtual voting algorithm, Byzantine agreement is guaranteed.Virtual voting happens in 3 steps:Divide RoundsDecide FameFind OrderDivide RoundsTo begin the process of virtual voting, we must first define rounds and witnesses. In the hashgraph history, the first event for a member’s node is that node’s first witness. The first witness is the beginning of the first round (r) for that node. All subsequent events are part of that first round until a new witness is discovered. A witness is discovered when a node creates a new event that can strongly see ⅔ of the witnesses in the current round. For example, event w can strongly see event x when w can trace its ancestry through parent relationships that pass through other events that reside on at least ⅔ of the member nodes. When an event is determined to strongly see ⅔ of the witness of the current round, that event is considered the next witness for that node. That new witness is the first event in the next round (r+1) for that node. Each event is assigned a round as the event is added to the hashgraph.Copyprocedure divideRounds --- for each event x\\n    r <- max round of parents of x (or 1 if none exist)\\n    if x can strongly see more than 2n/3 round r witnesses\\n        x.round <- r+1\\n    else\\n      x.round <- r\\n    x.witness <- (x has no self parent) --- or (x.round > x.selfParent.round)Decide FameThe next step is deciding whether a witness is a famous witness or not. A witness is famous if many of the witnesses in the next round can see it, and it is not famous if many can’t. Event A can see Event B if Event B is an ancestor of Event A. When deciding the fame of Witness A, we must look at the witnesses of the following round. If the witnesses of the following round can see Witness A, they count as a vote in favor of Witness A’s fame. Likewise, if a witness in the next round can not see Witness A, then that witness’ vote is that Witness A is not famous. In order for Witness A to be considered famous, a future witness must be able to strongly see that at least ⅔ of voting witnesses have voted in favor of Witness A being famous. If ⅔ of voting witnesses have voted that Witness A is not famous, then Witness A will be decided to be not famous.Find OrderNow that we have calculated the all witnesses of a round to be famous or not famous, we can determine the order of events that occurred before the famous witness events. This is done by calculating:The round received for all events that have yet to be ordered and that have occurred before a round where the fame of all witnesses has been decided. The event’s round received is the first round where all famous witnesses of that round can see (or are descendants of) the event in question.The timestamp for each event. This is done by gathering the earliest ancestors of the famous witnesses of the round received that are also descendants of the event in question, and taking the median timestamp of those gathered events.The ordering of events first by: round received, consensus timestamp, then signature.PreviousGossip About GossipNextTransactions and QueriesLast updated 6 months agoOn this pageDivide

PagePowered by GitBookGossip About GossipHashgraph consensus uses a gossip protocol. This means that a member such as Alice will choose another member at random, such as Bob, and then Alice will tell Bob all of the information she knows so far. Alice then repeats with a different random member. Bob repeatedly does the same, and all other members do the same. In this way, if a single member becomes aware of new information, it will spread exponentially fast through the community until every member is aware of It.The synchronization of information between two members through the gossip protocol is called a gossip sync. Upon completion of a gossip sync, each participating member commemorates the gossip sync with an event. An event is stored in memory as a data structure composed of a timestamp, an array of zero or more transactions, two parent hashes, and a cryptographic signature. The two parent hashes are the hash of the last event created by the self-parent prior to the gossip sync and the hash of the last event created by the other-parent prior to the gossip sync. For example, if Alice and Bob perform a gossip sync, Alice would create a new event commemorating the gossip sync where the self-parent hash would be the hash of the last event Alice created prior to the gossip sync and the other-parent hash would be the hash of the last event Bob created prior to the gossip sync. Bob would also create an event commemorating the gossip sync, but the self-parent hash would be the hash of the last event he created before the gossip sync and the other-parent hash would be the hash of the last event Alice created before the gossip sync. Gossip continues until all members have received the newly created event.Gossip About GossipThe history of how these events are related to each other through their parent hashes is called gossip about gossip. This history expresses itself as a type of directed acyclic graph (DAG), a graph of hashes, or a hashgraph. The hashgraph records the history of --- how members communicated. It grows directionally over time as more gossip syncs take place and events are created. All members keep a local copy of the hashgraph which continues to update as members sync with one another.These hashgraphs may be slightly different at any given moment, but they will always be consistent. Consistent means that if [Alice] and [Bob] both contain event x, then they will both contain exactly the same set of ancestors for x, and will both contain exactly the same set of edges between those ancestors.Each event contains the following:TimestampTwo hashes of two events below itselfSelf-parentOther-parentTransactionsDigital signatureItemDescriptionTimestamp:The timestamp of when the member created the event commemorating the gossip syncTransactions:The event can hold zero or more transactionsHash 1:Self-parent hashHash 2:Other-parent hashDigital Signature:Cryptographically signed by the creator of the eventPreviousHashgraph Consensus AlgorithmNextVirtual VotingLast updated 6 months agoOn this pageWas this helpful?Edit on GitHub INTRODUCTIONFeesCore ConceptsNetwork InformationEthereum & Hedera DifferencesTOOLSBridgeOraclesExplorersDeveloper Portal & FaucetRESOURCESStatusBug BountyBuild on Hedera (course)Documentation Survey',\n",

An agreement must be made on which blocks to produce,\\nwhich chain to adopt and to determine the single state of the network. The\\nconsensus protocol determines how individual nodes assess the current state of\\nthe ledger system and reach a consensus.\\nBlockchains create consensus by allowing participants to bundle transactions\\nthat others have submitted to the system in blocks, and add them to their chain\\n(sequence of blocks). Determining who is allowed to produce a block when, and\\nwhat to do in case of conflicts, (such as two participants adding different\\nblocks at the same point of the chain), is the purpose of the different\\nconsensus protocols.\\nThe protocol has three main responsibilities:\\n\\nperform a leader check and decide if a block should be produced\\nhandle chain selection\\nverify produced blocks. --- About Ouroboros\\u200b\\nCardano runs on the Ouroboros consensus protocol, which was delivered with\\nseveral peer-reviewed papers presented at top-tier conferences and publications\\nin the area of cybersecurity and cryptography. Rather than relying on 'miners'\\n(as in proof-of-work protocols) to solve computationally complex equations to\\ncreate new blocks – and rewarding the first to do so – proof of stake selects\\nstake pools to create new blocks\\nbased on the stake they control in the network.\\nHow Ouroboros works\\u200b\\nOuroboros divides time on Cardano into epochs where each epoch is divided into\\nslots. A slot is a short period of time in which a block can be created.\\nGrouping slots into epochs is central to adjusting the leader election process\\nto the dynamically changing stake distribution.\\nCentral to Ouroboros’ design is that it must retain its security in the presence\\nof attacks. As such, the protocol has built-in tolerance to prevent attackers\\nfrom propagating alternative versions of the blockchain and assumes that an\\nadversary may send arbitrary messages to any participant at any time. The\\nprotocol is guaranteed to be secure in the so-called synchronous setting (that\\nis, with strong guarantees on message delivery times) so long as more than 51%\\nof the stake is controlled by honest participants (ie, those following the\\nprotocol).\\nA slot leader is elected for each slot, who is responsible for adding a block to\\nthe chain and passing it to the next slot leader. To protect against adversarial\\nattempts to subvert the protocol, each new slot leader is required to consider\\nthe last few blocks of the received chain as transient: only the chain that\\nprecedes the prespecified number of transient blocks is considered settled. This\\nis also referred to as the settlement delay. Among other things, this means that\\na stakeholder can go offline and still be synced to the blockchain, so long as\\nit’s not for more than the settlement delay.\\nWithin the Ouroboros protocol, each network node stores a copy of the\\ntransaction mempool – where transactions are added if they are consistent with\\nexisting transactions – and the blockchain. The locally stored blockchain is\\nreplaced when the node becomes aware of an alternative, longer valid chain. --- Read the following section to learn more about the different types of Ouroboros.Edit this pagePreviousPledging and rewardsNextOuroboros overviewAbout OuroborosHow Ouroboros worksMore About CardanoCardano ExplorerCardano FoundationCardano.orgWhy CardanoDaedalusJoin the communityCardano CommunityCardano TelegramCardano ForumCardano RedditIOHKIOHK blogIOHK YouTubeCardano Foundation YouTubeCardano Foundation TwitterIOG AcademyLegalIOHK Privacy PolicyIOHK Terms & ConditionsSocialXFacebookYoutubeBlogCardano is an open-source project. --- Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.

In this way, the system validates and adds\\nblocks to the chain and also verifies transactions. A distributed network of\\nnodes must keep communication delays to a minimum, and be resilient enough to\\ncope with failures or capacity constraints.\\nIn the Byron federated system, nodes were connected by a static configuration\\nthat was defined in a topology file. Since the introduction of Shelley, the\\nsystem has been functioning in a hybrid mode. Moving from the federated state of\\nnetwork connectivity to the hybrid one, the teams delivered a manually\\nconstructed P2P network of SPO relay nodes. This means that SPO block-producing\\nnodes can connect to both trusted relay nodes and other SPO-run relay nodes.\\nHybrid connectivity is not automated, however, it enables the exchange of block\\nand transaction information without relying on trusted relays only.\\nA trusted relay is the one that the SPO, wallet, or exchange accessing the\\nnetwork ‘trusts’. Though this role has mostly been performed by IOG, other\\nentities, such as the Cardano Foundation, a wallet, or exchanges can also run\\ntrusted relays. Block-producing nodes can connect to any relays they deem\\ntrustable.\\n\\nFederated: introduced in the Byron development phase in 2017, trusted core\\nand relay nodes maintained the network and connected users, wallets, and\\nexchanges. --- Hybrid: since the Shelley development phase in 2020, block-producing nodes\\nsend and receive communications through trusted relays and/or a manual\\ncommunity-developed and managed tool called the\\ntopology updater.\\n\\n\\n\\nDynamic P2P: provides automation and resilience to optimize network\\nperformance. SPO relays can automatically connect to each other through\\nself-discovery and optimization.\\n\\n\\nTo ensure efficient communication between nodes, it is desirable to enable\\nautomated connections of SPO relays to each other, so that less static\\nconfiguration is needed. Dynamic P2P has been gradually enabled since the node\\nv.1.35.6\\nrelease. For more details, see\\nthis blog post.\\nWith the deployment of Dynamic P2P, networking keeps evolving with\\nadditions such as Ouroboros Genesis and peer sharing:\\n\\nOuroboros Genesis: in development. Anyone running their own node or Daedalus\\nwallet will connect to a fully decentralized and self-organized network.\\nGenesis enables secure node bootstrapping and the removal of trusted relays. Read this blog post to learn more about the transition to Genesis.\\n\\n\\n\\nPeer sharing: in development. Peer sharing will facilitate the discovery of\\npotential peers that are not registered on the chain within the overall\\nCardano node network. This phase will also allow anyone to contribute to\\nrunning the network, rather than just using resources from SPOs.\\n\\n\\nDynamic P2P capabilities\\u200b\\nThe network stack undergoes a number of improvements to achieve the desired\\nnetwork resilience. These improvements do not require a protocol change, but\\nrather enable automated peer selection and communication between peers and\\nnodes.\\nThe P2P networking is enabled due to the use of the following components: --- Outbound governor (formerly known as P2P governor) ‒ manages the automatic\\ninitiation of outbound connections between peers and classifies them as cold,\\nwarm, or hot (known, ready, or in use). The governor establishes a\\nconnectivity map of the local network. One part of the governor is the churn\\ngovernor, which optimizes the network graph by dropping the 20% lowest\\nperforming peers.\\nServer ‒ accepts connections. There is a soft and a hard limit on the\\nnumber of connections that influence the speed of connection acceptance.\\nInbound protocol governor ‒ runs and governs inbound network\\n‘mini-protocols’ on an accepted connection.\\nConnection manager ‒ tracks the state of each network connection: each one\\nmight be used as a warm or hot outbound connection or used by the inbound\\nside. Warm connections only keep connectivity while hot ones take an active\\npart in the consensus protocol.\\n\\nNext, we take a closer look at how the outbound governor works to ensure\\nautomated connectivity between peer nodes on the network.\\nOutbound governor functionality\\u200b\\nThe Cardano network consists of multiple peer nodes. Some peer nodes are more\\nactive than others, some have established connections, and some should be\\npromoted to ensure the best system performance. Each block-producing node\\nmaintains a set of peers mapped into three categories:\\n\\ncold peers ‒ existing peers without an established network connection\\nwarm peers ‒ peers with an established bearer connection, which is only used\\nfor network measurements without implementing any of the node-to-node\\nmini-protocols\\nhot peers ‒ peers that have a connection, which is being used by all three\\nnode-to-node mini-protocols. --- Newly discovered peers are initially added to the cold peer set. The outbound\\ngovernor is then responsible for peer connection management: it defines which\\npeers are beneficial for connection purposes, and which should be promoted or\\ndemoted between cold, warm, or hot sets.\\nThe primary goal of the outbound governor is to maintain the target number of\\ncold, warm, and hot peers. This builds and maintains a connectivity map of the\\nlocal part of the network, and simplifies the process of connection definitions\\nby handling them automatically.\\nTo establish connectivity between nodes, the outbound governor engages in the\\nfollowing activities:\\n\\npromotion of cold peers to warm peers\\ndemotion of warm peers to cold peers\\npromotion of warm peers to hot peers\\ndemotion of hot peers to warm peers.\\n\\nThe outbound governor needs to establish and maintain:\\n\\na target number of cold peers (for example, 100)\\na target number of hot peers (for example, between 2–20)\\na target number of warm peers (for example, between 10–50)\\na set of warm peers that are sufficiently diverse in terms of hop distance and\\ngeographic locations\\na target churn frequency for hot or warm changes\\na target churn frequency for warm or cold changes\\na target churn frequency for cold or unknown changes. --- Using 2–20 hot peers is cost-efficient, as peers exchange only their block\\nheaders. The block body, in turn, is typically requested only once, and it tends\\nto follow the shortest path through the connectivity graph.\\nThe purpose of warm peers is to provide access to those peers that can be\\nquickly promoted to hot ones (in case any of the hot peers fail), and also\\nprovide candidates for the churn of hot peers.\\nThe policy for selecting which warm peers to promote to hot relies on the\\nupstream measurements. The purpose of a degree of churn between cold and warm\\npeers is, in part, to discover the network distance between more peers and to\\nallow potentially better warm peers to take over from existing hot peers. This\\nenables further optimization and adjustments. Maintaining diversity in hop\\ndistances contributes to better block distribution times across the globally\\ndistributed network.\\nOverall, this approach follows a common pattern for probabilistic search or\\noptimization that uses a balance of local optimization with some elements of\\nhigher-order disruption to avoid becoming trapped in a poor local optimum.\\nPeers maintain a limited set of information, which is based on their previous\\ndirect interactions. Cold peers, for instance, may not maintain any data, as\\nthey have not established interactions yet. Such data can be compared to a\\n‘reputation’ property, however, these details are purely local and are not\\nshared among other nodes. Local peer reputation information is also updated when\\npeer connections fail. The network does not maintain negative peer information\\nfor extended periods of time: to bound resources and because of the simplicity\\nof\\nSybil attacks.\\nThe implementation classifies exceptions that cause connection failures into\\nthree classes:\\n\\ninternal node exceptions (for example, local disk corruption)\\nnetwork failures (for example, dropped TCP connections)\\nadversarial behavior (for example, a protocol violation detected by the\\ntyped-protocols layer or by the consensus layer). --- In the case of adversarial behavior, the peer can be immediately demoted from\\nthe hot, warm, or cold sets.Edit this pagePreviousNetworking protocol design overviewNextCardano fee structureDynamic P2P capabilitiesOutbound governor functionalityMore About CardanoCardano ExplorerCardano FoundationCardano.orgWhy CardanoDaedalusJoin the communityCardano CommunityCardano TelegramCardano ForumCardano RedditIOHKIOHK blogIOHK YouTubeCardano Foundation YouTubeCardano Foundation TwitterIOG AcademyLegalIOHK Privacy PolicyIOHK Terms & ConditionsSocialXFacebookYoutubeBlogCardano is an open-source project.\\n\\n      Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.

TCP/IP enables a reliable\\nbidirectional communication channel between systems on the internet.\\nThe ordered delivery of Cardano node communication protocols is guaranteed by\\nthe TCP/IP protocol.\\nOperating systems limit the number of concurrent connections. By default, Linux,\\nfor example, can open 1,024 connections per process, whereas macOS limits this\\nnumber to 256. To avoid excessive use of resources and enable reliable means for\\nconnection establishment, Cardano uses a multiplexer.\\nConnection management\\u200b\\nThe network layer handles a range of specific tasks besides the exchange of\\nblock and transaction information required by the Ouroboros protocol.\\nGenerally, connection management implementation includes the performance of the\\nfollowing tasks:\\n\\nopening a socket and/or acquiring resources from the OS\\nnegotiating the protocol version with the handshake mini-protocol\\nspawning the thread that runs the multiplexer (which can be instructed to\\nstart/stop various mini-protocols)\\ndiscovering and classifying exceptions thrown by mini-protocols or the\\nmultiplexer itself\\nshutting down the connection in case of an error\\nhandling a shutdown request from the peer\\nshutting down the threads that run mini-protocols\\nclosing a socket. --- Multiplexing\\u200b\\nThe multiplexing layer acts as a central crossing between mini-protocols and the\\nnetwork channel. It runs several\\nmini-protocols\\nin parallel in a single channel ‒ TCP connection, for example.\\nFigure 1 reflects how data flows between two nodes, each running three\\nmini-protocols using a multiplexer (MUX) and a de-multiplexer (DEMUX).\\n\\nFigure 1. Data flow between the nodes through multiplexing\\nData transmitted between nodes passes through the MUX/DEMUX of the nodes. There\\nis a fixed pairing of mini-protocol instances, which means that each instance\\nonly communicates with its dual instance (an initiator and a responder side).\\nThe implementation of the mini-protocol also handles serialization and\\nde-serialization of its messages. Mini-protocols write chunks of bytes to the\\nMUX and read chunks of bytes from the DEMUX. The MUX reads the data from\\nmini-protocols, splits it into segments, adds a segment header, and transmits\\nthe segments to the DEMUX of its peer. The DEMUX uses the segment’s headers to\\nreassemble byte streams for the mini-protocols on its side. The multiplexing\\nprotocol (see the note below) itself is completely agnostic to the structure of\\nthe multiplexed data.\\nnoteThis is not a generic, but specialized, use of multiplexing. Individual\\nmini-protocols have strict constraints on unacknowledged messages that can be in\\nflight. The design avoids the conditions in which the use of general TCP over\\nTCP multiplexing creates chaotic performance.\\nData segments of the multiplexing protocol\\u200b\\nMultiplexing data segments include the following details: --- Transmission time ‒ a timestamp based on the lower 32 bits of the sender’s\\nmonotonic clock with a resolution of one microsecond\\nMini-protocol ID ‒ the unique ID of the mini-protocol\\nPayload length ‒ the size of the segment payload in bytes; the maximum\\npayload length supported by the multiplexing wire format is 216 − 1. Note that\\nan instance of the protocol can choose a smaller limit for the size of\\nsegments it transmits\\nMode ‒ the single bit M (the mode) is used to distinguish the dual\\ninstances of a mini-protocol. The mode is set to 0 in segments from the\\ninitiator (the side that initially has agency), and it is set to 1 in segments\\nfrom the responder.\\n\\nCardano node communication protocols\\u200b\\nCardano uses inter-process communication (IPC) protocols to allow for the\\nexchange of blocks and transactions between nodes, and to allow local\\napplications to interact with the blockchain via the node.\\nNode-to-node IPC overview\\u200b\\nThe Node-to-node (NtN) protocol transfers transactions between full nodes. NtN\\nincludes three mini-protocols (chain-sync, block-fetch, and tx-submission),\\nwhich are multiplexed over a single TCP channel using a network-mux package.\\nThe following diagram represents the NtN operational flow:\\n\\nNtN follows a pull-based strategy, where the initiator node queries for new\\ntransactions and the responder node replies with the transactions if any exist.\\nThis protocol perfectly suits a trustless setting where both sides need to be\\nprotected against resource consumption attacks from the other side.\\nNtN mini-protocols explained\\nA brief explanation of the NtN mini-protocols: --- chain-sync: a protocol that allows a node to reconstruct a chain of an\\nupstream node\\nblock-fetch: a protocol that allows a node to download block bodies from\\nvarious peers\\ntx-submission: a protocol that allows submission of transactions. The\\nimplementation of this protocol is based on a generic mini protocol framework,\\nwith one peculiarity: the roles of the initiator and the responder are\\nreversed. The Server is the initiator that asks for new transactions, and the\\nClient is the responder that replies with the transactions. This role reversal\\nwas designed thus for technical reasons.\\n\\nTo ensure optimal networking service, the team has also implemented an\\nadditional protocol:\\n\\nkeep-alive: a protocol that ensures continuous connection between nodes\\nand minimizes performance faults.\\n\\nNode-to-client IPC overview\\u200b\\nNode-to-client (NtC) is a connection between a full node and a client that\\nconsumes data but does not take part in the Ouroboros protocol (a wallet, for\\nexample.)\\nThe purpose of the NtC IPC protocol is to allow local applications to interact\\nwith the blockchain via the node. This includes applications such as wallet\\nbackends or blockchain explorers. The NtC protocol enables these applications to\\naccess the raw chain data and to query the current ledger state, and it also\\nprovides the ability to submit new transactions to the system.\\nThe NtC protocol uses the same design as the node-to-node (NtN) protocol, but\\nwith a different set of mini-protocols, and using local pipes rather than TCP\\nconnections. As such, it is a relatively low-level and narrow interface that\\nexposes only what the node can provide natively. For example, the node provides\\naccess to all the raw chain data but does not provide a way to query data on the\\nchain. The job of providing data services and more convenient higher-level APIs\\nis delegated to dedicated clients, such as cardano-db-sync and the wallet\\nbackend.\\nNtC mini-protocols\\nThe NtC protocol consists of three mini-protocols: --- chain-sync - used for following the chain and getting blocks\\nlocal-tx-submission - used for submitting transactions\\nlocal-state-query - used for querying the ledger state.\\n\\nThe NtC version of chain-sync uses full blocks, rather than just block headers.\\nThis is why no separate block-fetch protocol is needed. The local-tx-submission\\nprotocol is like the NtN tx-submission protocol but simpler, and it returns the\\ndetails of transaction validation failures. The local-state-query protocol\\nprovides query access to the current ledger state, which contains a lot of\\ninteresting data that is not directly reflected on the chain itself.\\nHow NtC works\\nIn NtC, the node runs the producer side of the chain-sync protocol only, and the\\nclient runs the consumer side only.\\nThis table shows which mini-protocols are enabled for NtC communication:\\nEdit this pagePreviousCardano networkNextPeer-to-peer (P2P) networkingConnection managementMultiplexingData segments of the multiplexing protocolCardano node communication protocolsNode-to-node IPC overviewNode-to-client IPC overviewMore About CardanoCardano ExplorerCardano FoundationCardano.orgWhy CardanoDaedalusJoin the communityCardano CommunityCardano TelegramCardano ForumCardano RedditIOHKIOHK blogIOHK YouTubeCardano Foundation YouTubeCardano Foundation TwitterIOG AcademyLegalIOHK Privacy PolicyIOHK Terms & ConditionsSocialXFacebookYoutubeBlogCardano is an open-source project.\\n\\n      Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.

It consists of a collection\\nof nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger.\\nThese nodes are the actors on Cardano that validate blocks, add blocks to the\\nchain, and distribute transactions.\\nThe networking layer is the driving force for delivering information exchange\\nrequirements, which includes new blocks diffusion and transaction information\\nfor establishing a better data flow. Cardano nodes maintain connections with\\npeers that have been chosen via a custom peer selection process.\\ninfoRead the following specifications for more details:\\nThe Shelley networking protocol\\nAn introduction to the design of data diffusion and networking for Cardano Shelley. --- Data flow between and within nodes\\u200b\\nTo understand how nodes communicate with each other, let’s suppose that node A\\nis connected to node B. Then, the Ouroboros protocol schedules a node N to\\ngenerate a new block in a given time slot. Depending on the location of nodes\\nA, B, and N in the network topology, and whether a new block arrives first\\nat A or B, node A can be either upstream or downstream of node B.\\nA set of mini-protocols is used to enable communication between different nodes.\\nEach mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as\\ninforming peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new\\ntransactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols\\nare determined by the version of the network protocol. For example, there are\\ntwo protocol suites: node-to-node and node-to-client. The node-to-client\\nprotocol suite is used by wallets and chain consumers. Protocol suites use\\ndifferent sets of mini-protocols and the version is negotiated when a new\\nconnection is established using a specific protocol (protocols are described in\\nthe following sections).\\nClients can also choose which node-to-client mini-protocols to use, but it is\\nimportant to note that the node needs to be able to reply to all of them to\\nsupport different use cases. For example, to communicate, node A runs its\\nclient-side instance of the chain-sync mini-protocol that talks with a server\\ninstance of the chain-sync mini-protocol at node B. Such a situation is\\nsimilar to the functionality of other mini-protocols.\\nThe scheme below illustrates how data flows within a node. Circles represent\\nprotocol threads and internal threads that are responsible for running the\\nclient and server processes within the respective mini-protocols.\\n\\nTwo types of data flow exist: --- Mini-protocols communicate with mini-protocols of other nodes by sending and\\nreceiving messages across a public network (internet); this flow is not\\ncovered within the scheme above.\\nWithin a node, mini-protocols communicate with each other by reading from,\\nand writing to, a shared mutable variable, which is represented by boxes in\\nthe scheme. Arrows indicate whether a thread has read or write access to\\nthe shared state. --- Addressing network complexities and constraints\\u200b\\nTo design an efficient and robust networking architecture, a number of potential\\nissues regarding complexity and constraints have been evaluated.\\nCongestion control is one such feature and is used to deal with system\\noverload. Congestion control is vital to ensure that the system is robust enough\\nwhile operating high workloads. Within the networking design, it is common that\\nthe number of transactions that occur can be higher than the number that can be\\nactually processed for inclusion in the blockchain. Therefore, it is important\\nto ensure that the increasing rate of transaction submission into a block does\\nnot decrease the performance of blockchain.\\nThe actual node has a limit to the amount of data it can process. In particular,\\na node might have to share its processing power with other processes that run on\\nthe same machine or operating system instance. This means that a node can slow\\ndown and result in the system not being able to process all the available data\\nfrom the network.\\nTo address these issues, the congestion control feature has been designed to\\noperate appropriately in such a situation and recover from transient conditions.\\nIn any case, a node must not exceed its memory limits so there must be defined\\nmemory limits, breaches of which are treated as protocol violations. These\\nfactors mean that the system will be able to meet performance goals.\\nReal-time constraints and coordinated universal time are other aspects\\nthat have been considered while designing the networking architecture. In\\nCardano, Ouroboros consensus protocols model the passage of physical time as an\\ninfinite sequence of time slots, assigning slot leaders to create a new block in\\nthose time slots. Choosing a slot time, however, might cause certain\\ncomplexities in terms of the slot length, as it should be long enough for a new\\nblock to have a good chance to reach the next slot leader in time. Therefore, a\\nchosen value for the slot length was initially set to 20 seconds in the Byron\\nera. With Ouroboros Praos\\nimplemented in the Shelley era, a slot length of 1 second is chosen but, on\\naverage, only 0.05 of slots will produce a block (and thus on average, there\\nwill be 20-second intervals between blocks). It is assumed that the clock skews\\nbetween the local clocks of the nodes are small with respect to the slot length. --- Possible clock inaccuracies should still be taken into consideration, especially\\nwhen dealing with time-stamped incoming blocks. It is important to differentiate\\nwhether there is a time difference or whether the node considers an adversarial\\nbehavior of another node.\\nUtilizing mini-protocols\\u200b\\nMini-protocols are used to communicate between multiple nodes while implementing\\ninformation exchange requirements. A mini-protocol is a defined modular building\\nblock of the network protocol. Structuring the network protocol around mini-protocols helps to manage the overall complexity of the design while ensuring\\nuseful flexibility.\\nMini-protocols describe both the initiator and the responder within the\\ncommunication stream. The initiator is the dual element of the responder and\\nvice versa. A node typically runs many instances of mini-protocols, which\\nincludes many instances of the same mini-protocol. Each mini-protocol instance\\nof the node then communicates with the dual instance of the exact peer. All mini-protocols that communicate with the same peer share a single communication\\nchannel (pipe or socket). A multiplexer or de-multiplexer is used to multiplex\\nrespective protocols over that channel.\\nThe set of mini-protocols that is used for connection between two participants\\nof the system depends on the role of these participants, for instance, whether\\nthe node acts as a full node or a blockchain consumer (for example, a wallet).\\nIt is also worth noting that the implementation of mini-protocols uses a generic\\nframework for state machines. This framework uses correct-by-construction\\ntechniques to guarantee the implementation of several properties of the\\nprotocol. In particular, this technique assures that no deadlocks occur and\\ncommunication is canceled in the following scenarios: --- when one side is expected to transmit the next message, and the other side is\\nawaiting the message, and both sides agree that the protocol has been\\nterminated\\nwhen either side receives a message that is not expected according to the\\nprotocol.\\n\\nAll mini-protocols based on this framework include the following information in\\ntheir description:\\n\\nan informal description of the protocol\\nstate machine states\\nexchanged messages\\na transition graph of the state machine global view\\nthe client’s implementation of the protocol\\nthe server implementation of the protocol.\\n\\nExample mini-protocols\\u200b\\nThis section outlines some examples of mini-protocols.\\nPing pong protocol\\u200b\\nThis is a simple protocol for testing that a client can use to check that the\\nserver is responsive. The ping pong protocol is very simple because the messages\\ndo not carry any data and the ping pong client, as well as the ping pong server,\\ndo not access the internal state of the node.\\nRequest response protocol\\u200b\\nThe request response protocol is polymorphic in the request and response data\\nthat is being transmitted. This means that there are different possible\\napplications of this protocol and the application of the protocol determines the\\ntypes of requests sent and responses received.\\nChain synchronization protocol\\u200b\\nThe chain synchronization protocol is used by a blockchain consumer to replicate\\nthe producer’s blockchain locally. A node communicates with several upstream and\\ndownstream nodes and runs an independent client instance and an independent\\nserver instance for each node with which it communicates.\\nThe chain synchronization protocol is polymorphic. The node-to-client protocol\\nuses an instance of the chain synchronization protocol that transfers full\\nblocks, while the node-to-node instance only transfers block headers. In the\\nnode-to-node scenario, the block fetch protocol is used to transfer full blocks.\\nBlock fetch protocol\\u200b\\nThe block-fetching protocol enables a node to download a range of blocks.\\nLocal transaction submission mini-protocol\\u200b\\nThe local transaction submission mini-protocol is used by local clients, for\\nexample, wallets or CLI tools, to submit transactions to a local node. The\\nprotocol is not used to forward transactions from one core node to another. The\\nprotocol follows a simple request-response pattern: --- the client sends a request with a single transaction\\nthe server either accepts the transaction (returning a confirmation), or\\nrejects it (returning the reason). --- Node-to-node transaction submission protocol\\u200b\\nThe node-to-node transaction submission protocol is used to transfer\\ntransactions between full nodes. The protocol follows a pull-based strategy\\nwhere the initiator asks for new transactions and the responder replies with\\ntransactions. It is suitable for a trustless setting where both sides need to\\nguard against resource consumption attacks from the other side. The\\nimplementation of the node-to-node transaction mini-protocol is based on a\\ngeneric mini-protocol framework (the same as for all other mini-protocols). For\\ntechnical reasons, the roles of the initiator and the responder are reversed in\\nthis case compared to the way other mini-protocols are implemented in the\\nframework. In other words, the server is the initiator who requests new\\ntransactions, and the client is the responder who replies with transactions.\\nHandshake mini-protocol\\u200b\\nThe handshake mini-protocol is used to negotiate the protocol version and the\\nprotocol parameters that are used by the client and the server. It is used first\\nwhen a new connection is initialized and consists of a single request from the\\nclient and a single reply from the server. The handshake mini-protocol is a\\ngeneric protocol that can negotiate any kind of protocol parameters. It assumes\\nthat protocol parameters can be encoded to, and decoded from Concise Binary\\nObject Representation (CBOR) terms. A node that runs the handshake protocol must\\ninstantiate it with the set of supported protocol versions and callback\\nfunctions for handling the protocol parameters. These callback functions are\\nspecific to the supported protocol versions.Edit this pagePreviousCardano architectureNextNetworking protocol design overviewData flow between and within nodesAddressing network complexities and constraintsUtilizing mini-protocolsExample mini-protocolsPing pong protocolRequest response protocolChain synchronization protocolBlock fetch protocolLocal transaction submission mini-protocolNode-to-node transaction submission protocolHandshake mini-protocolMore About CardanoCardano ExplorerCardano FoundationCardano.orgWhy CardanoDaedalusJoin the communityCardano CommunityCardano TelegramCardano ForumCardano RedditIOHKIOHK blogIOHK YouTubeCardano Foundation YouTubeCardano Foundation TwitterIOG AcademyLegalIOHK Privacy PolicyIOHK Terms & ConditionsSocialXFacebookYoutubeBlogCardano is an open-source project. --- Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.

Firmly based on academic research and rigorous testing, this process has resulted in a chain with zero outages.\\nCardano has gone through multiple development phases and eras enabled by hard fork combinator events. The following concepts are explained below: --- Development phase – a high-level collection of features described on the Cardano roadmap.\\nLedger era – a collection of ledger features introduced with a hard fork. Starting with Alonzo, eras are planned to be named after mathematicians and computer scientists in a, b,c order.\\nIntra-era hard fork – a small and focused semantic change to the ledger requiring a hard fork.\\nConsensus mechanism – a collection of consensus features introduced with a hard fork. Historically, these have featured the name ‘Ouroboros’.\\nLedger protocol – a collection of ledger features between the consensus layer and the ledger layer, roughly characterized by block header validation.\\n\\nDevelopment phases\\u200b\\nCardano’s development phases include Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire – all named after poets except for Goguen, a computer scientist. --- Byron. Byron set the foundation for Cardano development allowing users to buy and sell ada on a proof-of-stake blockchain network. Initially, the Cardano ledger was established as a federated network, where block production and transaction validation were maintained by the founding entities. Byron saw the delivery of Daedalus and Yoroi wallets, and also provided users with a Block Explorer ‒ a tool specifically designed for browsing the blockchain.\\nShelley. The Shelley development theme introduced a decentralized ledger creating a completely new economic system, which drives the network’s growth and gradual optimization. Shelley evolved from Byron’s federated network maintenance, with more and more blocks being produced by the distributed stake pool operator community. This theme focused on many critical steps that ensure enhanced user experience in terms of stake pool operation, delegation preferences, and incentives.\\nGoguen. Goguen development focused on the establishment of a global, financial, and multi-functional system for decentralized application (DApp) building, smart contract support, and custom token issuance. Goguen is a key building block to establish a versatile platform to build solutions around such application domains as supply chain, track and trace, finance, medical records, identity voting, property registration, P2P payments, and many others.\\nBasho. Basho focuses on Cardano’s optimization in terms of improving the scalability and interoperability of the network. Whereas other development stages focus on decentralization and new functionality, Basho is about improving the underlying performance of the Cardano network to better support growth and adoption for applications with high transaction volume.\\nVoltaire. Decentralized governance and decision making lie at the heart of Voltaire granting the Cardano community the ability to vote on network development updates, technical improvements, and project funding. For the Cardano network to become more decentralized, it requires not only the distributed infrastructure introduced during Shelley but also the capacity to be maintained and improved over time in a decentralized way. --- Ledger eras\\u200b\\nThere are several eras within the evolution of Cardano. Each era refers to the rules of the ledger. For example, what transaction types and what data is stored in the ledger, or the validity and meaning of the transactions.\\nByron and Shelley eras\\u200b\\nThe evolution of the Cardano mainnet began with the Byron ledger rules. The mainnet underwent a hard fork in late July 2020 to switch from the Byron rules to the Shelley ledger rules. It was a full reimplementation of Cardano, which enabled two fundamental changes: the support for multiple sets of ledger rules, and the management of the hard fork process of switching from one set of rules to the next. In other words, the new implementation could support both the Byron rules and the Shelley rules, which meant that, when deployed to the mainnet in early 2020, the implementation was fully compatible with the Byron rules. This allowed for a smooth transition from the old to the new implementation. Once all Cardano users had upgraded their nodes to the new implementation, it became possible to invoke the hard fork combinator event and switch to the Shelley rules.\\nAllegra, Mary, and Alonzo eras\\u200b\\nAllegra, Mary, and Alonzo eras are all part of the Goguen development phase.\\nStarting with Goguen, the ledger team introduced the notion of era into the ledger code. Shelley ledger rules then became ‘the Shelley era’.\\nBecause Goguen features were implemented in steps, each set of functionality was introduced with a different hard fork, hence there were several ledger eras:\\n\\nAllegra: introduced token locking support\\nMary: brought native tokens and multi-asset functionality to Cardano\\nAlonzo: introduced smart contract support. --- The names Allegra and Mary were chosen for their connection to the poet Percy Shelley and were only intended to be used as variable names for a very specific abstraction used in the ledger code.\\nGoguen, the smart contract development phase, was the only phase named not after a poet. So the name of the ledger era that introduced smart contracts was named after Alonzo Church – the person who invented the lambda calculus (Plutus Core uses a variant of system F).\\nGoing forward, the teams decided to use names in a,b,c order, after individuals who contributed to mathematics and computer science. One lack of consistency to notice is that eras can use both first and last names. This is driven by conciseness.\\nBabbage era\\u200b\\nThe Babbage ledger era introduced such features as inline datums, reference scripts, and reference inputs. However, the release is also known as Vasil, named to honor the late Bulgarian mathematician and Cardano ambassador Vasil Dabov.\\nIntra-era hard forks\\u200b\\nA new era must be introduced with a hard fork, but the ledger can also change semantics during a controlled hard fork with another mechanism – an intra-era hard fork. This is an implementation detail that involves bumping the major protocol version but not creating a new ledger era. The Alonzo era, for example, experienced an intra-era hard fork when going from major protocol version 5 to 6.\\nYou can see a table with Cardano’s phases, eras, and intra-era hard forks visualized below: --- Image source: CIP-59 Cardano features annex\\nConclusion\\u200b\\nIt is important to understand that not all of the semantic changes to the Cardano network involve the ledger. Changes to the consensus protocol or the networking layer may also require a hard fork. There is also an abstraction between the consensus and ledger layers, named the protocol. The distinction between the ledger protocols and the ledger eras corresponds roughly to how block headers are validated (protocol) versus how block bodies are validated (era). The Shelley era used the ‘transitional Praos’ protocol (TPraos), which consisted of Praos combined with a transition system to move away from Ouroboros BFT. The Babbage era replaced TPraos with Praos.\\nNote that the protocol version is unrelated to the node-to-node and node-to-client protocol versions. The consensus layer maintains a versioning scheme for the node queries that does not necessarily align with the protocol version described in this overview.\\nThe protocol version is also included in each block header indicating the maximum protocol version that the block producer is capable of supporting.Edit this pagePreviousDesign rationaleNextAbout hard forksDevelopment phasesLedger erasByron and Shelley erasAllegra, Mary, and Alonzo erasBabbage eraIntra-era hard forksConclusionMore About CardanoCardano ExplorerCardano FoundationCardano.orgWhy CardanoDaedalusJoin the communityCardano CommunityCardano TelegramCardano ForumCardano RedditIOHKIOHK blogIOHK YouTubeCardano Foundation YouTubeCardano Foundation TwitterIOG AcademyLegalIOHK Privacy PolicyIOHK Terms & ConditionsSocialXFacebookYoutubeBlogCardano is an open-source project.\\n\\n      Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.

It serves multiple purposes, such as paying transaction processing fees, rewarding network participants, and facilitating fast, scalable, and secure transactions. Moreover, ALGO can be staked to earn rewards and participate in the governance of the Algorand ecosystem. Paying for transaction fees as a Good/Service: The primary use of the ALGO token on the Algorand network is to pay for transaction fees. These fees are required to process and validate transactions on the blockchain. Each transaction incurs a small fee from the user. Moreover, decentralised applications (dApps) built on Algorand, such as AlgoFi, leverage ALGO for various transactions within their ecosystems. Users of AlgoFi, a leading DeFi platform on Algorand, utilize ALGO to pay for transaction fees when swapping tokens, lending, or borrowing assets on the platform\\u200b. Transaction fees on Algorand are around 0.001 ALGO. Atomic Transfers as a Good/Service: Atomic transfers allow the trading of assets without the need for a trusted intermediary, all while guaranteeing that each party will receive what they agreed to. Smart Contracts as a Good/Service: Algorand features a two-tiered smart contract system, enabling on-chain and off-chain applications and providing developers with the flexibility to create diverse and complex applications. Algorand provides Layer-1 smart contracts, a secure fast-path for common, everyday transactions. Second, Algorand provides (Layer-2) off-chain contracts for the “long tail” of smart contracts that require more customization. Layer 1 of the Algorand network enables the implementation of simple smart contracts, asset creation, and atomic swaps between assets. Layer 2 of the Algorand network is designated for more intricate smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps). By offloading complex transactions and computations to Layer 2, Algorand can maintain fast transaction speeds and low fees on its main chain, making it an ideal platform for the ever-evolving world of decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its key features are shown below: Layer 2 feature - DeFi: The Algorand blockchain enables DeFi applications to operate at tremendous scale, with low transaction costs, and with a negligible carbon footprint. Its Layer 2 smart contract capabilities, and interoperability frameworks provide DeFi organisations with the opportunity to leverage Algorand’s technology for a range of use cases, from lending and borrowing to asset management and decentralised exchanges. Layer 1 feature - Algorand Standard Assets (ASA): The Algorand protocol supports the creation of on-chain assets that benefit from the same security, compatibility, speed and ease of use as the Algo. The official name for assets on Algorand is Algorand Standard Assets (ASA). With Algorand Standard Assets you can represent stablecoins, loyalty points, system credits, and in-game points. Furthermore, ASAs enable NFT minting by providing a simple and efficient way to create and manage NFTs on the Algorand blockchain. Each ASA has a unique identifier, called an Asset ID, that represents a specific token and ensures an NFT is unique and cannot be duplicated. Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) are a standardised framework for tokenizing any type of asset on the Algorand blockchain. This framework allows developers to create and manage assets with a set of predefined rules and features, ensuring security, compatibility, and ease of use. To create an ASA, developers use Algorand’s REST API or SDKs to define the asset’s parameters, such as total supply, decimals, default frozen state, and manager addresses. Once created, these assets can be transferred, managed, and utilised within the Algorand network. Layer 1 feature - Highly customisable smart contracts ASC’s Voting Governance as a Good/Service: Algorand ended its Staking program in 2022 and has since been replaced by governance rewards. Governance is a decentralised program where ALGO holders can join and vote on the allocation of ALGO tokens to various projects. You can commit your ALGOs to governance for a three-month period, vote on the measures proposed by the Algorand Foundation, and earn rewards for doing so. Voting Feature - Algorand Governance (xGov): Algorand Community Governance comprises two programs: xGov and Governance. The programs differ in terms of participant eligibility and the measures that participants are required to vote on. Anyone can participate in Governance, while xGovs must have participated in at least one Governance Period (GP) before joining the xGov program under the current rules. Both xGovs and Governors play important roles in decision-making; however, the proposals put to xGovs will require more understanding, research, and discussion before casting a vote. \\u200d The xGov program marks an evolution of Algorand Community Governance, and its first iteration aims to create an expert layer of governors who have a deep understanding of the blockchain’s inner workings and the realities of the Algorand community. xGovs will be required to apply their acumen to funding decisions, including grant applications, that align with our mission of growing the Algorand ecosystem. \\u200d xGovs must commit their Governance Rewards for a 12-month Term, while Governors must commit their tokens for a 3-month GP.

The Python on Algorand experience comes wrapped in AlgoKit 2.0, a comprehensive toolset that provides everything you need to build, test, and deploy on Algorand, including an easy ten-minute onboarding. Dynamic Round Times: Implemented dynamic round times to increase network performance, reducing block times and enhancing transaction throughput\\u200b (Algorand Foundation)\\u200b. An algorithm adjusts block finality based on network congestion and other factors, enabling average round times to drop. With this upgrade, block times will average less than three seconds. Builders will benefit from the flexibility of dynamic round times as it enhances the efficiency and scalability of the Algorand network. End-users will experience quicker confirmations at a point-of-sale speed with which they’re familiar, creating a seamless and timely interaction with the blockchain. Consensus Incentivization: Algorand began incentivizing consensus participation directly, aiming to further decentralize and secure the network\\u200b (Algorand Foundation)\\u200b. Future plans 2024/2025: Improving and upgrading Dynamic Round Times which will further decrease block times. Further enhancing the Python integration through increased upgrades. AlgoKit will see additional upgrades throughout 2024, including improvements to localnet and sandbox, for an enriched experimenting environment. The introduction of Python unit testing will help users write secure code, and a visual debugger tool will help identify and solve issues quickly. the smart contract experience will also be upgraded, and the rollout of app-building libraries will allow users to easily incorporate third-party smart contracts into their own applications. AlgoKit is evolving to make the development journey smoother and more feature-packed than ever before. Algorand's future plans include modifying its network topology by transitioning a higher proportion of relay nodes to non-archival status. Initially, all relay nodes were required to store a complete copy of the ledger, which ensured multiple viable copies of the chain history. However, as the network has grown, this approach has become increasingly energy-intensive and costly. By shifting more relay nodes to non-archival status, Algorand aims to make the network greener and more efficient. Non-archival relays will still function effectively but will no longer need to maintain the full ledger history, significantly reducing operational costs. This change will contribute to a more streamlined and environmentally conscious ecosystem, improving the network's overall sustainability and efficiency\\u200b Algorand Foundation will further contribute funds to boost the incentive reward amounts for its consensus incentivization. Over time, as adoption of Algorand grows and modifications to the fee structure are implemented, transaction fees will become more meaningful and should be able to sustain the security of the network on its own. To further promote decentralization, Algorand is shifting away from this relay structure to a P2P gossip network, similar to how Bitcoin and many other crypto networks operate. In this model, data flows directly between consensus nodes, creating a decentralized spider web-like structure. This looks to reduce the reliance on relay nodes, making the network fully viable even without relays present. The evolution towards a P2P network signifies a significant step towards a more enduring future for Algorand, where it can operate independently and remain resilient to potential disruptions. This adjustment aligns with the core ethos of decentralized technology, ensuring Algorand’s autonomy and resilience in the long run. Embarking on the next chapter of innovation in 2025, Algorand will continue to pursue technical excellence, further solidifying its commitment to redefining accessibility in blockchain. Algorand will introduce support for even more programming languages in AlgoKit 3.0 and incorporate more world-class tooling and debugging capabilities, promising an unparalleled development experience. Algorand developers will have an even more diverse set of tools at their disposal, fueling the long-term evolution of blockchain development.\"]}, {'query': 'Who are the organisations and people involved with the development of Cardano?', 'ground_truths': [\"Cardano’s development is managed by three organizations: the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOHK.

This accounts for 11.7% of the total supply, allocated to strategic initiatives. Furthermore, around 16% of ADA’s circulating supply was allocated to the project’s founders.\"\n",

            "The Ouroboros Genesis Paper (Ouroboros Genesis: Improved Agreement and Interoperability) proposes a new type of consensus protocol called Ouroboros Genesis that is capable of reaching consensus on the Cardano blockchain in synchronous networks. This paper describes an extension to the Ouroboros Genesis consensus protocol that enables interoperability between Ledger-based UTxO systems and Data-oriented UTxO systems.\n",
            "The Ouroboros Genesis paper is available with several peer-reviewed papers presented at top-tier conferences and publications in the area of cybersecurity and cryptography. Rather than relying on 'miners' (as in proof-of-work protocols) to solve computationally complex equations to create new blocks – and rewarding the first to do so – proof of stake selects stake pools to create new blocks based on the stake they control in the network.\n",
            "To protect against adversarial attempts to subvert the protocol, each new slot leader is required to consider the last few blocks of the received chain as transient: only the chain that precedes the prespecified number of transient blocks is considered settled. Among other things, this means that a stakeholder can go offline and still be synced to the blockchain, so long as it’s not for more than the settlement delay.\n",
            "How Ouroboros works (Ouroboros Genesis Paper):\n",
            "The protocol has built-in tolerance to prevent attackers from propagating alternative versions of the blockchain and assumes that an adversary may send arbitrary messages to any participant at any time. The protocol is guaranteed to be secure in the so-called synchronous setting (that is, with strong guarantees on message delivery times) so long as more than 51% of the stake is controlled by honest participants (ie, those following the protocol).\n",
